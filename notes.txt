We have two options how to model the game
    - explicit max(min) modeling --> we are aware of the opponent
    - implicit solo-player modeling --> we assume that there is only one player and handle the opponent by either states or rewards

Current Value Iteration has a turn-dependent opponent handling.
    - each valid state is considered
    - current player is derived from the state
    - value iteration subtracts opponent gains and adds own gains

Next idea
    - halve the valid states to where the player X is allowed to make move and never consider player Y
    - e.g. all states where sum(x) == sum(y) are allowed, as long as the configuration is valid
    - rewards will be kept the same, but most likely only the positive reward is needed
